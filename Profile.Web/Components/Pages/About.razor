<h1>About this site</h1>

<p>
    This site was made with <code>Blazor</code>, <code>C#</code> and <code>tailwindcss</code> with <a
        href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox" target="_blank">gruvbox</a> theme with focus to
    navigate via <code>vim</code>-like browsers or extensions.
    I tried to make it simple and minimalistic.
    But it also should looks good on mobiles.
</p>

<p>
    I'll try to make it dinamycly update. For now it is avaliable only in English in case of development convenience.
    But I know it should be also in differrent languages (such as Russian or Armenian).
